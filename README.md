Modified version of Razor AHRS v1.4.2
---
**The original work: https://github.com/Razor-AHRS/razor-9dof-ahrs
**I only added two output modes oft and ofb; 'f' means that both angles and calibrated sensor values are outputted; 't' and 'b' mean the output values are available as text and binary data respectively.
